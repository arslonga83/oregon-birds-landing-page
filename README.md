#Birding Adventures Landing Page

A sample landing page website built with Bootstrap. Mostly this project was practice for learning some core Bootstrap designs so I can add it to my resume. I tried to imagine a simple quick-build landing site for a small business. I built a simple Express server to handle the contact form - it validates the entries and forwards them as an email to the "business owner."

Overall a fun project. The live demo is hosted on Netlify here:
